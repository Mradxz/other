              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                            (history)


1.0
~~~
 Just a experimental program with very weak possibilities (just a 
simple keylog). Was completely rewritten in the next versions.

2.0
~~~
 Now it sends a keylog. Added ripping of cached passwords (*.pwl). 
Installs in registry to the  user-defined path.  It is possible to
define max size of a  log-file,  after which Hooker  recreates it. 
Added  keylog of  windows  with pre-defined words in title.  Added 
self-destructing feature.

2.1
~~~
 Added sending of log after overflow.

2.2 beta 1
~~~~~~~~~~
 Fixed  huge  bug in keylogging  -  hook-function must be in  DLL!
Troyan became much stable. Added feature of http-files download.

2.2 beta 2
~~~~~~~~~~
 Fixed bug in function which adds system dates.

2.3 beta 1..4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Added detection  of  a  RAS-connections.  Fixed  bug in  using of
critical sections - sometimes there was conflicts of threads.  Now
keylogging DLL is packed by LZW. Some minor bugs fixed.

2.3 beta 5
~~~~~~~~~~
 Fixed bug  with sending of keylog.  If in window press only  ".",
troyan  wasn't  able to send  mail  preperly  (Hooker simply flood 
mailbox with big amount of messages).

2.3 beta 6
~~~~~~~~~~
 Little changes in  sendmail-procedure.  Fixed unpleasant feature:
Hooker didn't start on machine without rasapi32.dll - for example,
on WinNT, which is not using Dial-Up Networking.  Now, if this dll
is not present Hooker simply do not detect RAS-connections.

2.4
~~~
 No more betas! It's a release.
 Fixed  little bug  in  username and  hostname  detection. Added a
couple of features:
 full keylog:  if not checked, Hooker will log only windows, where
was keystrokes.
 advanced log: if not checked, Hooker will not log extended keys
(such as "Shift", "Alt" etc).
 Also fixed bug in connection by IP.
